# Memory-Game
The Cartoon Memory Game is a web-based game that challenges players to match pairs of cards. The game is built using Vue.js and Vite for fast and efficient development, with TailwindCSS for styling and responsive design. Pinia is used as a state manager to handle game logic, while Oh Vue Icons! provides a library of icons for enhanced visual appeal. Vitest is used for testing to ensure the game is functioning correctly.
